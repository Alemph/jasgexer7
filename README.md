Overview

This project is part of the CMSC 100 - Web Programming Laboratory course at the University of the Philippines Los Ba√±os. It focuses on front-end scripting to create a dynamic web page that allows users to interact with food items. The main functionality includes adding new food items via a form and managing the display order based on a ranking system.
Features

    Static File Serving: HTML, CSS, and JS files are served from a server setup.
    Dynamic Content Management: Users can add food items with details such as name, description, image URL, and rank. Items are displayed in order of rank.
    Interactive Elements: Each food card has a 'Delete' button to remove the item from the display.
